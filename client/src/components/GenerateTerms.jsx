It sets out the terms on which a website user (and potentially a new or existing customer of the company) can use the website and access the information the company provides through that website.
            Website terms of use - in short
            Purpose of this website terms of use template: As the mighty beast that your website is likely to be, you’ll likely be providing a lot of varied information, services, and functions to visitors of the website. Understandably, you’ll need to set out the terms under which your website visitors interact with your site, which is where your website terms of use come into play. Having clear and comprehensive website terms of use can help protect your business, establish guidelines for use of the website, and ensure that your website is being used in the way in which it is intended.

            How to use this website terms of use template: This website terms of use template is a set of terms which can be accessed on a company’s website and set out the terms on which a website user (and potentially a new or existing customer of the company) uses the website. Website terms of use are usually located via a link at the bottom of every page on a website so that they can be easily located by website visitors.

            How can my website benefit from this website terms of use template?
            Protect your business: Website terms of use can be an important legal document to protect your business and website. This includes:

            Keep your intellectual property secure: Website terms of use can include provisions that protect your website&apos;s intellectual property, such as your trade marks (e.g. logos) and copyright (e.g. website content). This can help prevent others from misusing or copying your content, to protect the value in it.
            Clear restrictions on use: Website terms of use can include clear restrictions on use so that it’s clear how a website visitor can and cannot use your website. This can help prevent any misuse of your website.
            Limiting your liability: Website terms of use should include clauses that limit your liability for any damages that may arise from the use of your website. This can be crucial to minimise your potential financial exposure in the event of a claim by a website visitor.
            Clarify your rights: Website terms of use can outline your rights and remedies in the event that a user breaches the terms. For example, you can include a right to terminate or suspend a website visitor’s access to your website.
            What does this website terms of use template include?
            Key details: This website terms of use template informs the user of a number of key details, including:

            who the website owner is - in particular, registered companies are required by UK company law to provide certain information about the company on its website. Docue’s website terms of use template is an easy way to ensure that all required information is included;
            the website users’ rights and restrictions around the use of the company’s website;
            protection of intellectual property rights;
            relationship with third-party links and sites that may be included in the content of the website; keeping passwords and account information secure;
            ability to vary the terms;
            limits on liability; and
            governing law and jurisdiction.
            The website terms of use template assumes that the company whose website the terms are located on is incorporated in the UK and that English law applies.

            What other documents do I need on my website?
            Website terms of use are just one of the documents that should be located on a website. Websites may also need to include:

            Website privacy notice - it is a strict requirement of UK data protection laws to provide a privacy notice to individuals when you collect (or process) personal data about them. You will collect personal data about website visitors - whether that’s through your online shop, via a contact form on your website or through tracking technologies such as cookies. It’s therefore crucial that a privacy notice is provided to website visitors, so they know how their personal data is being used.
            Cookies notice - almost every website will use cookies in order to function and perform to their full potential. Data protection laws require you to tell individuals about the cookie on your website and how they affect website visitors.
            Legal notices - website disclaimers enable you to clearly set out important warnings, statements or notices on your website that you intend to have a binding legal effect to website visitors.
            Acceptable use policy - this is a policy that specifically governs a website visitor’s use of the function or features of, or information presented on, the website.
            Terms of sale - if your website has an online shop, you also need to include terms that deal with the products being sold on your website (e.g. payment terms, delivery, responsibilities in relation to the products): Docue has a number of different dynamic terms of sale templates ready for use:
            Online terms for the sale of goods;
